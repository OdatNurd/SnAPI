%hyperhelp title="Custom Options" date="2018-06-18"


When implementing a command to act as a build system target, the command's
keyword arguments are available via options in the `.sublime-build` file.
However, certain parameter names will not work since they conflict with built-
in build system functionality.

The following names will not be passed as arguments to commands. This also
applies to other situations, such as options specified in the `cancel`, `linux`,
`osx` and `windows` options.

  * `cancel`
  * `file_patterns`
  * `keyfile`
  * `keyfiles`
  * `linux`
  * `osx`
  * `save_untitled_files`
  * `selector`
  * `target`
  * `variants`
  * `windows`
