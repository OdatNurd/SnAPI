%hyperhelp title="Variables" date="2019-03-31"


The following variables will be expanded within any string specified in the
`"cmd"`, `"shell_cmd"` or `"working_dir"` options.

If a literal `$` needs to be specified in one of these options, it must be
escaped with a `\`. Since JSON uses backslashes for escaping also, `$` will
need to be written as `\\$`.

Please note that this substitution will occur for any `target`. If a custom
target is used, it may implement variable expansion for additional options by
using `sublime.expand_variables()` with the result from
`self.window.extract_variables()`.
