%hyperhelp title="Sublime Text 3 Build Systems" date="2018-06-14"


Sublime Text provides `build` systems to allow users to run external programs.
Examples of common uses for build systems include: compiling, transpiling,
linting, and executing tests.

Build systems are specified via JSON and saved in a file with the extension
`.sublime-build`. A new build system can be created by the Tools ▶ Build System
▶ New Build System… menu item or the `Build: New Build System` command palette
entry.

Build systems have various ways they can associate themselves with files and
projects. Using this information, Sublime Text can intelligently display only
viable build systems to the user. The built-in `exec` target provides common
options to get up and running quickly. For more complex requirements, build
systems can target custom Sublime Text commands written in Python.
