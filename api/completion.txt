# completion:completion Value
==================

Represents an available auto-completion item. `completion` values may be
of several formats. The term trigger refers to the text matched against
the user input, replacement is what is inserted into the view if the
item is selected. An annotation is a unicode string hint displayed to
the right-hand side of the trigger.

  ## _none:str

    A unicode string that is both the trigger and the replacement

    ```python
    return [
        "method1()",
        "method2()"
    ]
    ```


  ## _none: 2-element `list`/`tuple`

   A pair of unicode strings, the trigger and the replacement.

    ```python
    return [
        ["me1", "method1()"],
        ["me2", "method2()"]
    ]
    ```

    If a `\t` is present in the trigger, all subsequent text is treated as an
    annotation.

    ```python
    return [
        ["me1\tmethod", "method1()"],
        ["me2\tmethod", "method2()"]
    ]
    ```

    The replacement text may contain dollar-numeric fields such as a snippet
    does, e.g. `$0`, `$1`.

    ```python
    return [
        ["fn", "def ${1:name}($2) { $0 }"],
        ["for", "for ($1; $2; $3) { $0 }"]
    ]
    ```


  ## _none: CompletionItem object  `[>=4050]`

    A |CompletionItem| object containing trigger, replacement, annotation, and
    kind metadata

    ```python
    return [
        sublime.CompletionItem(
            "fn",
            annotation="def",
            completion="def ${1:name}($2) { $0 }",
            completion_format=sublime.COMPLETION_FORMAT_SNIPPET,
            kind=sublime.KIND_SNIPPET
        ),
        sublime.CompletionItem(
            "for",
            completion="for ($1; $2; $3) { $0 }",
            completion_format=sublime.COMPLETION_FORMAT_SNIPPET,
            kind=sublime.KIND_SNIPPET
        ),
    ]
    ```
