# settings:Settings Class
================

Represents settings as set in a file |view| or stored in a `sublime-settings`
file. This class acts like a `dict`, but is not iterable.

In `[>=4050]` the `dict` nature of settings objects is enhanced with the
introduction of  `__getitem__`, `__setitem__` and `__contains__` methods,
allowing you to get and set settings as if the settings object was truly a
`dict`.


*settings.get*(name, <default>)
  Returns: |value|

    Returns the named setting, or `default` if it's not defined. If not passed,
    `default` will have a value of `None`.


*settings.set*(name, value)
  Returns: None

    Sets the named setting. Only primitive types, `list`s, and `dict`s are
    accepted.


*settings.setdefault*(name, default)   `[UNDOCUMENTED]`  `[>=4050]`
  Returns: |value|

    Returns the named setting, or `default` if it's not defined. In the case
    where the setting was not previously set, the provided `default` value is
    used to set the setting prior to return.


*settings.erase*(name)
  Returns: None

    Removes the named setting. Does not remove it from any parent Settings.


*settings.has*(name)
  Returns: bool

    Returns `True` iff the named option exists in this set of Settings or one
    of its parents.


*settings.add_on_change*(key, on_change)
  Returns: None

    Register a callback to be run whenever a setting in this object is changed.


*settings.clear_on_change*(key)
  Returns: None

    Remove all callbacks registered with the given `key`.
