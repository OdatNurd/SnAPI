*|textcommand:TextCommand Class|*
=================

TextCommands are instantiated once per view. The View object may be retrieved
via `self.view`

This class is contained in the |sublime_plugin| module.


*TextCommand.run*(edit, <args>)
  Returns: None

    Called when the command is run.


*TextCommand.is_enabled*(<args>)
  Returns: bool

    Returns `True` if the command is able to be run at this time. The default
    implementation simply always returns `True`.


*TextCommand.is_visible*(<args>)
  Returns: bool

    Returns `True` if the command should be shown in the menu at this time. The
    default implementation always returns `True`.


*TextCommand.description*(<args>)
  Returns: str

    Returns a description of the command with the given arguments. Used in the
    menus, and for Undo / Redo descriptions. Return `None` to get the default
    description.


*TextCommand.want_event*()
  Returns: bool

    Return `True` to receive an `event` argument when the command is triggered
    by a mouse action. The event information allows commands to determine which
    portion of the view was clicked on. The default implementation returns
    `False`.


*TextCommand.input*(<args>)
  Returns: |CommandInputHandler| or None

    If this returns something other than None, the user will be prompted for an
    input before the command is run in the Command Palette.
