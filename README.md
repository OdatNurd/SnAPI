SnAPI
=====

SnAPI is a simple package that provides a local copy of the Sublime Text
[documentation](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/) directly
from within Sublime, using the [hyperhelp](https://github.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/hyperhelpcore)
help system for navigation.

 > ***Note:*** Currently only the Sublime Text API, build system  and color
 > theme documentation is in place in SnAPI. Other reference help from the
 > official documentation set is still forthcoming.

SnAPI is pronounced "Snappy", as having API documentation readily available from
directly within Sublime keeps you focused on your coding. Also it was a name
suggested to me that stuck in my head. Please blame @kingkeith for suggesting
the name and my brain for latching onto it so completely.

Also, please note that all help text and documentation is taken directly from
the above linked official API reference and is Copyright © Sublime HQ Pty Ltd.

**NOTE:** Although there is only help contained within the package, it is still
in active development and as such everything is subject to change.
