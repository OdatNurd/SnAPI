Color schemes based on the `.sublime-color-scheme` format are specified by
filename only, not a package-based file path. This allows users to customize a
color scheme by overriding variables or globals, and adding rules.

To create a user-specific customization of a color scheme, create a new file
with the same filename as the color scheme, but save it in the `Packages/User/`
directory.

For example, to customize the default Monokai color scheme, create a file named
`Packages/User/Monokai.sublime-color-scheme`. The following settings will
change the background color to be a fully-desaturated grey, the yellow to be
more vibrant, and will add a new rule change Python docstrings to be colored
the same as strings.

```json
{
    "variables":
    {
        "yellow": "hsl(54, 100%, 50%)",
    },
    "globals":
    {
        "background": "hsl(70, 0%, 15%)",
    },
    "rules":
    [
        {
            "name": "Python docstrings",
            "scope": "comment.block.documentation.python",
            "foreground": "var(yellow)"
        },
    ]
}
```

The contents of the `variables` and `globals` objects are merged, with the
user's copy overwriting keys with the same name. For the `rules` list, the
user's rules are appended.
