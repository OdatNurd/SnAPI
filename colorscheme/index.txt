%hyperhelp title="Sublime Text Color Schemes" date="2020-05-07"


The highlighting of source code and prose in Sublime Text is controlled by a
color scheme. A color scheme assigns colors and font styles to scopes, which
are assigned to the text by the syntax. The rest of the look of the user
interface is controlled by the theme. The |theme| controls such elements as
buttons select lists, the sidebar and tabs.

Sublime Text color schemes are implemented using `.sublime-color-scheme` files,
containing JSON. Sublime Text also supports a subset of features using the
TextMate |:tmTheme:tmTheme| format.

Before Sublime Text 3.1, only the .tmTheme format was supported.
