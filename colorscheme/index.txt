%hyperhelp title="Sublime Text 3 Color Schemes" date="2019-03-31"


The highlighting of source code and prose in Sublime Text is controlled
by a color scheme. A color scheme assigns colors and font styles to
scopes, which are assigned to the text by the syntax. The rest of the
look of the user interface is controlled by the theme. The theme
controls such elements as buttons select lists, the sidebar and tabs.

Sublime Text color schemes are implemented using .sublime-color-scheme
files, containing JSON. Sublime Text also supports a subset of features
using the TextMate .tmTheme format.
